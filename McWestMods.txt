Change:
Top level folder structure (changed names have comment afterward)
  /app
  /assets (instead of content)
  /components (new, a place to keep local, non third party components)
Why:
  more specific folder names
  move 3rd party components dirs such as bower_components to parent directory
  do not use a tet directory, instead place test files in same folder as files under test

Change:
Omit the type from controller file names (e.g. do not use formulation.controller.js, use formulation.js)
Why:
Controllers are still easily identifiable.

Change:
Omit the 'Controller' suffix from controller names (e.g. do not use FormulationController, use Formulation)
Why:
Controllers are still easily identifiable.

Addition:
Name feature modules using correct plurality (e.g. use 'dashboard' for a module that
implements only one dashboard, but use 'nutrients' not 'nutrient' for a module that implements processing of
one or more nutrients).
Why:
Names should be consistent with plurality.

Change: 
Order functions in controller by functionality, not alphabetical by name. 
Why: 
It is easy to find a function by name using an IDE. Sorting functions by functionality 
allows consistent location of similar types of functionlity, regardless of function name. 
For example, a controller responsible for Create, Read, Update, and Delete data operations might have its create functions first, 
then read, then update, and finally delete.
